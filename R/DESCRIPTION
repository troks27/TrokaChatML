Description: TrokaChatML is an integrated computational framework designed for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data to uncover perturbed cell--cell communications and identify potential therapeutic targets. The pipeline combines differential expression analysis, machine learning-based noise filtration and perturbed communication prediction, tensor decomposition, and knowledge graph--driven drug target discovery, providing a robust and scalable approach from raw data processing to actionable biological insights.
